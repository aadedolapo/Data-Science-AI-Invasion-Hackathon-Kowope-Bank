# Data-Science-AI-Invasion-Hackathon-Kowope-Bank

A Repo of my solution to the DSN Bootcamp Qualification competition

Position on Leader Board -- 76th of 405
## Overview Of the Project
Kowepe bank of Nigeria conducted marketing campaigns via phone calls with their clients. The purpose of these campaigns is to prompt their clients to subscribe to a specific financial product of the bank (term deposit). This survey had been conducted with some selected individuals that the bank feel is the best representative of their clients so as to minimize the cost of the total client survey.

You have been contacted as a data scientist to find patterns and build predictive models on this dataset with the aim of forecasting the percentage of potential customers for the financial products of the bank.
## Evaluation
The evaluation metric for this competition is Mean F1-Score. The F1 score, commonly used in information retrieval, measures accuracy using the statistics precision p and recall r. Precision is the ratio of true positives (tp) to all predicted positives (tp + fp). Recall is the ratio of true positives to all actual positives (tp + fn). The F1 score is given by:

[ F1 = 2\frac{p \cdot r}{p+r}\ \ \mathrm{where}\ \ p = \frac{tp}{tp+fp},\ \ r = \frac{tp}{tp+fn} ]

The F1 metric weights recall and precision equally, and a good retrieval algorithm will maximize both precision and recall simultaneously. Thus, moderately good performance on both will be favored over extremely good performance on one and poor performance on the other.
